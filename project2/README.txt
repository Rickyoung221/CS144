Hi!
Glad to see you.
After unzip the project, you can build it by:
./deploy.sh

After we deploy the files, we can access it through url:
for example:
http://localhost:8888/editor/post?action=open&username=user_XYRSAF&postid=1

And also you can access it by terminal:
for example:
Requesting http://localhost:8080/editor/post?action=open&username=user_XYRSAF&postid=1

Hoping you have a good time and stay healthy.
